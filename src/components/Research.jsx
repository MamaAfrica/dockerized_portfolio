            <h1>Design and Implementation of an Embedded Poultry Farm</h1>
            <h2>July 2019
            Conference: 2019 IEEE 1st International Conference on Mechatronics, Automations and Cyber-Physical Computer Systems (IEEE MAC 2019)At: Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria</h2>
            <p className="about__text p__color">Many poultry farmers are performing diverse operations manually. They, therefore, experience a huge financial loss as a result of their inability to properly automate the monitoring and control of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and to ensure an adequate supply of light and water. These factors adversely affect the chicks and lead to respiratory, digestive and behavioural disorders. This affects the chicks' food intake and leads to an increase in mortality rate and chances of diseases. Therefore, this paper seeks to address these factors by developing an embedded poultry farm. The system was developed using microcontroller, actuators and sensors as the major components while Proteus 8 is the tool used for the design. The system when tested was able to sense environmental parameter status and respond accordingly to regulate and maintain an optimum condition for improved health condition for the chicks. The automated system will help for the purpose of improving productivity and environmental or climatic conditions in the poultry farm, making it conducive for the broiler chicks.</p>
